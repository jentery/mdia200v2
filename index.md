# Territory Acknowledgement 

As a researcher and instructor at the University of Victoria, I acknowledge and respect the lək̓ʷəŋən peoples on whose traditional territory the University stands, and the Songhees, Esquimalt, and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day. I'm a settler scholar at UVic, and I arrived here as an uninvited guest in July 2011. 

In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAgS8kOsjYY), Songhees Elder Elmer George welcomes visitors to the traditional lands of the Songhees, Esquimalt, and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ people in lək̓ʷəŋən and English. The acknowledgement in this video was prepared in consultation with local Indigenous communities.

The fact that we're gathering at UVic to study media is a product of colonization and injustice upon local lands, waters, and people. I continue to learn about those injustices, and I will make no assumptions about your knowledge or experiences of them. As part of this course, I invite ongoing dialogue about not only territory acknowledgements but also how UVic students, faculty, and staff are building good relations and fostering reciprocity. 

I've learned a lot about territory acknowledgements from the Native Students Union's [webpage](https://www.uvicnsu.ca/about/lands) as well as this August 2019 [episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/76wRKpfhNDS08ehRvtETmR) of *U in the Ring*: "With Knowledge Comes Responsibility: Territory Acknowledgements," featuring Jeff Ganohalidoh Corntassel, Maggie Easton, Steven Farina, Robbie Lewis, Qwul'sih'yah'maht Robina Thomas, and Kolin Sutherland-Wilson. I welcome your recommendations, too.

# Description

This course "surveys the cultural and material roles media play around the world in the 21st century. Emphasis on building a common vocabulary for studying media as well as understanding how audio, images, video, and text mediate people’s relation to culture." See [MDIA200 - Media in the 21st Century](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/courses/HyVj9LZJi?bc=true&bcCurrent=MDIA200%20-%20Media%20in%20the%2021st%20Century&bcGroup=Media%20Studies%20(MDIA)&bcItemType=courses) in UVic's academic calendar. 

This course counts toward UVic's [Media Studies](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/media-studies/program/index.php) certificate, which requires 10.5 units of coursework. 

# Goals

I designed this course for you to: 

1. Build a vocabulary for understanding media. This means you'll develop a language for attending to the particulars of audio, images, text, video, and interfaces. 
2. Learn a variety of techniques for engaging media today. This means we'll not only discuss but also practice different approaches to examining and experiencing audio, images, text, video, and interfaces in the 21st century. 
3. Account for context and culture in the analysis of media across the globe. This means we'll consider how, where, when, by whom, for whom, and under what assumptions media are made,interpreted, and circulated. 
4. Respond regularly and actively to classroom activities and lectures about media. This means you'll complete four worksheets to demonstrate what you're learning.  
5. Reflect on your learning and communicate its applications to the study and production of media today. This reflection will assume the form of a portfolio, which will be your final project in this course. 

I will assume you've no experience in Media Studies, and I will focus on critical approaches to media as they apply to content production. I will not teach film. For that, I recommend [Film Studies](https://www.uvic.ca/finearts/film). I also won't teach technical or professional practices related to media. For that, I recommend [Professional Communication](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/english/professionalcommunication/).

# About Me 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I skip a syllable and say it in two: "JEN-tree." You can call me Jentery, Doctor Sayers, or Professor Sayers. 

I spend 11.67% of the day looking for my glasses, and I enjoy writing about games and media. I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and went to Virginia Commonwealth University for my BA and BS degrees. Then I moved to Seattle, where I received an MA and PhD in English from the University of Washington. I now teach courses for UVic Media Studies and English, and I'm the acting director of Media Studies. I like to play TTRPGs, drums, guitar, and soccer in my spare time. 

You can email me at [jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca) or find me in Clearihue D331. I do my best to maintain an [online portfolio](https://jntry.work/) of my work. 

# Materials 

You do *not* need to purchase a textbook or any primary sources for this course, but you will need access to a computer, the internet (including Brightspace), a camera, and a microphone. Most of the primary sources are publicly available online. I will provide you with PDF copies of them when they are not. 

I will also provide you with handouts and slides each week to define key terms in Media Studies, enhance your learning, point you to additional resources, and help you to complete assignments.

If this ends up being too much for the term, then we'll cut material or some of it will become optional.

*Handouts*: I will circulate handouts in Brightspace each week to help you prepare for class sessions. They will include concise overviews of key themes and terms for the purposes of participating in class activities and completing assignments. 

*Slide Decks*: I will create an HTML slide deck for most if not all class sessions. A link to the pertinent slide deck will be available in Brightspace immediately before class begins. This way, you can access the slides during and after class. 
 
*Brightspace*: I'll use the course Brightspace to: 

* Circulate a class announcement each Wednesday to help you plan for what's next,  
* Provide you with copies of my slides, handouts, and assigned materials, 
* Point you to other assigned materials available online, 
* Accept all your assignments (please don't submit anything to me by email),  
* Comment on those assignments, and  
* Mark those assignments according to rubrics I'll provide.    

# Assignments

There are no exams, quizzes, presentations, group projects, or participation marks in this course.

I am asking you to complete five assignments this term. 

1. **[Worksheet 1](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200v2/worksheet1.html)**: 20% of your final grade; covers material from Weeks 1-3 (due by Thursday, February 1st at 10am)
2. **[Worksheet 2](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200v2/worksheet2.html)**: 20% of your final grade; covers material from Weeks 4-6 (due by Thursday, February 15th at 10am)
3. **[Worksheet 3](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200v2/worksheet3.html)**: 20% of your final grade; covers material from Weeks 6-9 (due by Thursday, March 14th at 10am)
4. **[Worksheet 4](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200v2/worksheet4.html)**: 15% of your final grade; covers material from Weeks 10-12 (due by Thursday, April 4th at 10am)
5. **[Portfolio](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200v2/portfolio.html)**: 25% of your final grade (due by Thursday, April 18th at 10am) 

*Worksheets*: The worksheets will ask you to use particular Media Studies techniques to apply what you're learning in class. I will distribute each worksheet about three or four weeks before it's due via Brightspace. A worksheet will never contain more than five prompts, and I will encourage you to use class time to draft your responses to those prompts.

*Portfolio*: You'll conclude the course by producing a portfolio that documents what you learned in this course, reflects on it, and communicates its significance to other students at UVic.  

*Brightspace*: Please use Brightspace to submit all your work. You need not purchase any software to use Brightspace, but you will need your UVic NetLink ID, access to the internet, and a computer. I cannot accept assignments by email. Thank you for understanding.  

*Feedback*: I will provide brief and focused feedback on worksheets according to their rubrics. Please email me or schedule an appointment (F2F or Zoom) to discuss any feedback I provide. Please also note that I'm teaching this course while parenting, serving on multiple committees, conducting research, writing a book, and directing UVic's Media Studies program. I respond to emails Monday through Friday, 9am - 5pm, excluding holidays. Thanks in advance for your patience. 

# Workload

The most important thing to know about this course is that *I'll opt for care in every instance.* If the workload becomes too much, or we're juggling more than we should, then we'll cut material. I planned for the maximum in advance, under the assumption that we won't get to everything. And that's totally fine.

I suggest dedicating *3 to 5 hours of study and practice* to MDIA 200 each week in addition to our weekly meetings on Monday and Thursday. Of course, 3 to 5 hours per week is only a guideline. You may find that you need more or less time depending on the activity, your preferences, and your own familiarity with the work and materials involved.

I will give you time during class to draft responses to prompts in your worksheets; however, you will need more time (between classes) to develop and refine your work, hence the recommended 3 to 5 hours per week.  

# Schedule

Here's the schedule for the term. It's subject to change. In fact, I'm 97.56% certain there will be changes. I will use a Brightspace announcement to notify you at least two weeks in advance of those changes, and I will never use schedule changes to increase your workload (e.g., add an assignment or reading). 

*All materials are available via Brightspace. Please study them prior to the date they're assigned.* This way, we can make the most of our time together.
