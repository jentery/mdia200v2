# Territory Acknowledgement 

As a researcher and instructor at the University of Victoria, I acknowledge and respect the lək̓ʷəŋən peoples on whose traditional territory the University stands, and the Songhees, Esquimalt, and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day. I'm a settler scholar at UVic, and I arrived here as an uninvited guest in July 2011. 

The fact that we're gathering at UVic to study media is a product of colonization and injustice upon local lands, waters, and people. I am still learning about the past and present of those injustices, and I will make no assumptions about your knowledge or experiences of them. As part of this course, I invite ongoing dialogue about not only territory acknowledgements but also how UVic students, faculty, and staff are building good relations and fostering reciprocity. 

I've learned a lot about territory acknowledgements from the Native Students Union's [webpage](https://www.uvicnsu.ca/about/lands) as well as this August 2019 [episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/76wRKpfhNDS08ehRvtETmR) of *U in the Ring*: "With Knowledge Comes Responsibility: Territory Acknowledgements," featuring Jeff Ganohalidoh Corntassel, Maggie Easton, Steven Farina, Robbie Lewis, Qwul'sih'yah'maht Robina Thomas, and Kolin Sutherland-Wilson. I welcome your recommendations, too.

# Description

This course "surveys the cultural and material roles media play around the world in the 21st century. Emphasis on building a common vocabulary for studying media as well as understanding how audio, images, video, and text mediate people’s relation to culture." See [MDIA200 - Media in the 21st Century](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/courses/HyVj9LZJi?bc=true&bcCurrent=MDIA200%20-%20Media%20in%20the%2021st%20Century&bcGroup=Media%20Studies%20(MDIA)&bcItemType=courses) in UVic's academic calendar. 

This course counts toward UVic's [Media Studies](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/media-studies/program/index.php) certificate, which requires 10.5 units of coursework. 

# Goals

I designed this course for you to: 

1. Build a vocabulary for understanding media. This means you'll develop a language for attending to the particulars of audio, images, text, video, and interfaces. 
2. Learn a variety of techniques for engaging media today. This means we'll not only discuss but also practice different approaches to examining and experiencing audio, images, text, video, and interfaces in the 21st century. 
3. Account for context and culture in the analysis of media across the globe. This means we'll consider how, where, when, by whom, for whom, and under what assumptions media are made,interpreted, and circulated. 
4. Respond regularly and actively to classroom activities and lectures about media. This means you'll complete four worksheets to demonstrate what you're learning.  
5. Reflect on your learning and communicate its applications to the study and production of media today. This reflection will assume the form of a portfolio, which will be your final project in this course. 

I will assume you've no experience in Media Studies, and I will focus on critical approaches to media as they apply to content production. I will not teach film. For that, I recommend [Film Studies](https://www.uvic.ca/finearts/film). I also won't teach technical or professional practices related to media. For that, I recommend [Professional Communication](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/english/professionalcommunication/).

# About Me 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I skip a syllable and say it in two: "JEN-tree." You can call me Jentery, Doctor Sayers, or Professor Sayers. 

I spend 11.67% of the day looking for my glasses, and I enjoy writing about games and media. I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and went to Virginia Commonwealth University for my BA and BS degrees. Then I moved to Seattle, where I received an MA and PhD in English from the University of Washington. I now teach courses for UVic Media Studies and English, and I'm the acting director of Media Studies. I like to play TTRPGs, drums, guitar, and soccer in my spare time. 

You can email me at [jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca) or find me in Clearihue D331. I do my best to maintain an [online portfolio](https://jntry.work/) of my work. 

# Materials 

You do *not* need to purchase a textbook or any primary sources for this course, but you will need access to a computer, the internet (including Brightspace), a camera, and a microphone. Most of the primary sources are online. I will provide you with PDF copies of them when they aren't.

I'll use the course Brightspace to: 

* Circulate a class announcement each Wednesday to help you plan for what's next,  
* Provide you with copies of my slides, handouts, and assigned materials, 
* Point you to other assigned materials available online, 
* Accept all your assignments (please don't submit anything to me by email),  
* Comment on those assignments, and  
* Mark those assignments according to rubrics I'll provide.    

If this ends up being too much for the term, then we'll cut material or some of it will become optional.
