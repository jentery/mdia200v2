# Territory Acknowledgement 

As a researcher and instructor at the University of Victoria, I acknowledge and respect the lək̓ʷəŋən peoples on whose traditional territory the University stands, and the Songhees, Esquimalt, and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day. I'm a settler scholar at UVic, and I arrived here as an uninvited guest in July 2011. 

In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAgS8kOsjYY), Songhees Elder Elmer George welcomes visitors to the traditional lands of the Songhees, Esquimalt, and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ people in lək̓ʷəŋən and English. The acknowledgement in this video was prepared in consultation with local Indigenous communities.

The fact that we're gathering at UVic to study media is a product of colonization and injustice upon local lands, waters, and people. I continue to learn about those injustices, and I will make no assumptions about your knowledge or experiences of them. As part of this course, I invite ongoing dialogue about not only territory acknowledgements but also how UVic students, faculty, and staff are building good relations and fostering reciprocity. 

I've learned a lot about territory acknowledgements from the Native Students Union's [webpage](https://www.uvicnsu.ca/about/lands) as well as this August 2019 [episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/76wRKpfhNDS08ehRvtETmR) of *U in the Ring*: "With Knowledge Comes Responsibility: Territory Acknowledgements," featuring Jeff Ganohalidoh Corntassel, Maggie Easton, Steven Farina, Robbie Lewis, Qwul'sih'yah'maht Robina Thomas, and Kolin Sutherland-Wilson. I welcome your recommendations, too.

# Description

This course "surveys the cultural and material roles media play around the world in the 21st century. Emphasis on building a common vocabulary for studying media as well as understanding how audio, images, video, and text mediate people’s relation to culture." See [MDIA200 - Media in the 21st Century](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/courses/HyVj9LZJi?bc=true&bcCurrent=MDIA200%20-%20Media%20in%20the%2021st%20Century&bcGroup=Media%20Studies%20(MDIA)&bcItemType=courses) in UVic's academic calendar. 

This course counts toward UVic's [Media Studies](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/media-studies/program/index.php) certificate, which requires 10.5 units of coursework. 

# Goals

I designed this course for you to: 

1. Build a vocabulary for understanding media. This means you'll develop a language for attending to the particulars of audio, images, text, video, and interfaces. 
2. Learn a variety of techniques for engaging media today. This means we'll not only discuss but also practice different approaches to examining and experiencing audio, images, text, video, and interfaces in the 21st century. 
3. Account for context and culture in the analysis of media across the globe. This means we'll consider how, where, when, by whom, for whom, and under what assumptions media are made,interpreted, and circulated. 
4. Respond regularly and actively to classroom activities and lectures about media. This means you'll complete four worksheets to demonstrate what you're learning.  
5. Reflect on your learning and communicate its applications to the study and production of media today. This reflection will assume the form of a portfolio, which will be your final project in this course. 

I will assume you've no experience in Media Studies, and I will focus on critical approaches to media as they apply to content production. I will not teach film. For that, I recommend [Film Studies](https://www.uvic.ca/finearts/film). I also won't teach technical or professional practices related to media. For that, I recommend [Professional Communication](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/english/professionalcommunication/).

# About Me 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I skip a syllable and say it in two: "JEN-tree." You can call me Jentery, Doctor Sayers, or Professor Sayers. 

I spend 11.67% of the day looking for my glasses, and I enjoy writing about games and media. I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and went to Virginia Commonwealth University for my BA and BS degrees. Then I moved to Seattle, where I received an MA and PhD in English from the University of Washington. I now teach courses for UVic Media Studies and English, and I'm the acting director of Media Studies. I like to play TTRPGs, drums, guitar, and soccer in my spare time. 

You can email me at [jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca) or find me in Clearihue D331. I do my best to maintain an [online portfolio](https://jntry.work/) of my work. 

# Materials 

You do *not* need to purchase a textbook or any primary sources for this course, but you will need access to a computer, the internet (including Brightspace), a camera, and a microphone. Most of the primary sources are publicly available online. I will provide you with PDF copies of them when they are not. 

I will also provide you with handouts and slides each week to define key terms in Media Studies, enhance your learning, point you to additional resources, and help you to complete assignments. 

*Primary Sources*: We'll study the following primary sources this term: 

* The [Instagram Egg](https://www.instagram.com/world_record_egg/) (2019), by world_record_egg

If this ends up being too much for the term, then we'll cut material or some of it will become optional.

*Handouts*: I will circulate handouts in Brightspace each week to help you prepare for class sessions. They will include concise overviews of key themes and terms for the purposes of participating in class activities and completing assignments. 

*Slide Decks*: I will create an HTML slide deck for most if not all class sessions. A link to the pertinent slide deck will be available in Brightspace immediately before class begins. This way, you can access the slides during and after class. 
 
*Brightspace*: I'll use the course Brightspace to: 

* Circulate a class announcement each Wednesday to help you plan for what's next,  
* Provide you with copies of my slides, handouts, and assigned materials, 
* Point you to other assigned materials available online, 
* Accept all your assignments (please don't submit anything to me by email),  
* Comment on those assignments, and  
* Mark those assignments according to rubrics I'll provide.    

# Assignments

There are no exams, quizzes, presentations, group projects, or participation marks in this course.

I am asking you to complete five assignments this term. 

1. **[Worksheet 1](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200v2/worksheet1.html)**: 20% of your final grade; covers material from Weeks 1-3 (due by Thursday, February 1st at 10am)
2. **[Worksheet 2](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200v2/worksheet2.html)**: 20% of your final grade; covers material from Weeks 4-6 (due by Thursday, February 15th at 10am)
3. **[Worksheet 3](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200v2/worksheet3.html)**: 20% of your final grade; covers material from Weeks 6-9 (due by Thursday, March 14th at 10am)
4. **[Worksheet 4](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200v2/worksheet4.html)**: 15% of your final grade; covers material from Weeks 10-12 (due by Thursday, April 4th at 10am)
5. **[Portfolio](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200v2/portfolio.html)**: 25% of your final grade (due by Thursday, April 18th at 10am) 

*Worksheets*: The worksheets will ask you to use particular Media Studies techniques to apply what you're learning in class. I will distribute each worksheet about three or four weeks before it's due via Brightspace. A worksheet will never contain more than five prompts, and I will encourage you to use class time to draft your responses to those prompts.

*Portfolio*: You'll conclude the course by producing a portfolio that documents what you learned in this course, reflects on it, and communicates its significance to other students at UVic.  

*Brightspace*: Please use Brightspace to submit all your work. You need not purchase any software to use Brightspace, but you will need your UVic NetLink ID, access to the internet, and a computer. I cannot accept assignments by email. Thank you for understanding.  

*Feedback*: I will provide brief and focused feedback on worksheets according to their rubrics. Please email me or schedule an appointment (F2F or Zoom) to discuss any feedback I provide. Please also note that I'm teaching this course while parenting, serving on multiple committees, conducting research, writing a book, and directing UVic's Media Studies program. I respond to emails Monday through Friday, 9am - 5pm, excluding holidays. Thanks in advance for your patience. 

# Workload

The most important thing to know about this course is that *I'll opt for care in every instance.* If the workload becomes too much, or we're juggling more than we should, then we'll cut material. I planned for the maximum in advance, under the assumption that we won't get to everything. And that's totally fine.

I suggest dedicating *3 to 5 hours of study and practice* to MDIA 200 each week in addition to our weekly meetings on Monday and Thursday. Of course, 3 to 5 hours per week is only a guideline. You may find that you need more or less time depending on the activity, your preferences, and your own familiarity with the work and materials involved.

I will give you time during class to draft responses to prompts in your worksheets; however, you will need more time (between classes) to develop and refine your work, hence the recommended 3 to 5 hours per week.  

# Schedule

Here's the schedule for the term. It's subject to change. In fact, I'm 97.56% certain there will be changes. I will use a Brightspace announcement to notify you at least two weeks in advance of those changes, and I will never use schedule changes to increase your workload (e.g., add an assignment or reading). 

*All materials are available via Brightspace. Please study them prior to the date they're assigned.* This way, we can make the most of our time together. 

If you miss a class session, or you simply want a review, then I recommend checking Brightspace to view the slide deck for that session and touching base with a peer to see if they're willing to share their notes for the day.

# Policies 

Here are the policies for this course. Please let me know if anything is unclear, ignorant, or mistaken. I'll correct it. 

### Prerequisites 

Academic Writing Requirement satisfied. 

### Media Studies Certificate 

This course counts toward UVic's [Media Studies certificate](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/media-studies/program/index.php). 
  
### Assessment and Feedback

Two of the four Worksheets as well as the Portfolio are required to pass this course. Failure to complete these three assignments will result in a failing N grade (calculated as a 0 for your GPA). 

I will use UVic's [official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies) to produce rubrics to assess your work. I will not post marks publicly or outside my office, and I do not use plagiarism or AI detection software.

All assignments should be submitted via Brightspace. I cannot accept Worksheets or the Portfolio via email. 

I will use Brightspace to provide feedback on your work. If you ever want additional feedback, then feel free to ask me. I can provide it in person, via Zoom, or by email. 

Throughout the term, I'll request feedback from you on how the course is going. I'll also ask you to complete Course Experience Surveys at the end of the term. 

### Late Submissions and Extensions

I've a 24-hour grace period (no questions asked, no email required, and no penalties) for every Worksheet in this course. This means that I will not penalize you for submitting any Worksheet by Friday at 10am (one day after it's due via Brightpsace). A late penalty of 5 points per business day will apply after 24 hours. I do not consider weekends or holidays to be business days. 

I will not accept Worksheets more than two weeks after they are due and cannot accept the Portfolio more than a week after it is due.

Please email me if you need an extension for any assignment, and we can discuss possibilities on a case-by-case basis.    

### Attendance and Participation

There is no participation or attendance mark in this course; however, it is driven by class discussion and workshops, all of which are difficult to record or "capture." 

I will assume you are attending each class meeting. If you are unable to attend a particular meeting, then please email me in advance and coordinate with a peer to get notes and the like from the session(s) you'll miss. 

*You do not need to provide me with documentation for an absence.*

### Communications and Office Hours

The best way to communicate with me is by email ([jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca)) or during office hours, which are Monday, 11:30am - 12:30pm, in CLE D331. I can also make an appointment to meet with you in person or via Zoom. 

I respond to email between 9am and 5pm, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. 

### Learning Climate  

The University of Victoria is committed to promoting, providing, and protecting a positive, supportive, and safe working and learning environment for all its members. We are expected to adhere to [UVic's equity and human rights policies](https://www.uvic.ca/equity/) and the [Tri-Faculty Code of Professional Behaviour](https://www.uvic.ca/services/advising/assets/docs/tri-fac-student-code-of-conduct.pdf). You should alert me immediately if you have any questions about these policies and their application, or if you have concerns about course proceedings or participants.

### Academic Integrity  

We are expected to adhere to [UVic's academic integrity policy](https://www.uvic.ca/students/academics/academic-integrity/index.php) and be aware of the policies for the evaluation of student work. Violations of the integrity policy may result in a failing grade for the given assignment and may additionally result in a failing grade for the course. By taking this course, you agree that all submitted assignments may be subject to an originality review. I do not use software to detect plagiarism or AI in essays, exams, or any other assignments.

I also recommend the [Libraries' plagiarism guide](https://www.uvic.ca/library/help/citation/plagiarism/) for learning more about academic integrity. You are of course always welcome to talk to me, too. 

### Copyright 

All course materials, including my slides, handouts, and lectures, are made available for educational purposes and the exclusive use of students in this course.

### Online Conduct 

The University of Victoria is committed to promoting critical academic discourse while providing a respectful and supportive learning environment.

Any concerns about student conduct may be reviewed and responded to in accordance with the appropriate university policy. To report concerns about online student conduct, email [onlineconduct@uvic.ca](mailto:onlineconduct@uvic.ca).

### Accessibility

If you have a disability or health consideration that may require supports, please feel free to approach me and/or the [Centre for Accessible Learning (CAL)](https://www.uvic.ca/accessible-learning/index.php) as soon as possible. CAL staff are available by appointment to assess specific needs, provide referrals, and arrange appropriate supports. I will never ask you to disclose a diagnosis, health consideration, or disability to me, and I know that access needs are social, cultural, and structural issues that aren't always addressed, or adequately addressed, by institutions such as the academy. 

### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 

I aim to create an inclusive learning environment that attends to difference and honours each of you, including your experiences at the intersections of race, ethnicity, gender, disability, sexuality, religion, power, and class. I want to be a resource for you, and I continue to learn about diversity, equity, and inclusion. If something is said in class (by anyone, including me) that makes you feel uncomfortable, then don't hesitate to talk with me. If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your university records, then let me know, and I'll correct the documents provided to me. If your performance in the class is being impeded by your experiences outside of class, then keep me posted, and we'll make adjustments. I also welcome any suggestions to improve the quality of the course and its culture and materials, and I will make available mechanisms for anonymous feedback since you may prefer them.

The following student groups may be relevant to your life as a student here at UVic: 

* [The Native Students Union](https://www.uvicnsu.ca/) "is an organization run for and by Indigenous students at UVic. Since circa 1969, Indigenous students have been coming together to form community, support each other, advocate for Indigenous rights and wellbeing, and just exist together at the institution. The NSU runs events and programs, manages a student space with services, and advocates for Indigenous student success and wellness at UVic. The NSU Council leads the NSU in running and developing these services." 
* [The Students of Colour Collective](https://soccollective.com/) "are a Collective of self-identified people of colour at the University of Victoria. Anyone identifying as BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and Person of Colour) is welcome to use our lounge and access our resources. SOCC exists to create space that fosters community building, and facilitates networking and gatherings for self-identified BIPOC folks. Our work centres on art, awareness, education, action, advocacy, and support. Every student of colour is welcome to get in touch and find out how to get involved."
* [The Society for Students with a Disability (SSD)](https://uvicssd.ca/) "is a post-secondary student advocacy group under the University of Victoria Students’ Union which promotes the full participation and inclusion of students who self-identify as having one or more disabilities at the University of Victoria. The SSD aims to support students who self-identify as having one or more disabilities; in particular, we support students to reduce barriers in the social, emotional, and educational domains of student life."
* [The Gender Empowerment Centre (GEM)](https://genderempowermentcentre.ca/) "is an inclusive space, focused on the needs of self-identified women, non-binary, trans and gender non-conforming folks to organize, network, access resources, attend workshops and events, study, and relax. Our space is open to both University of Victoria students and community members."
* [UVic Pride Collective](https://pridecollective.ca/) "is committed to practicing decolonization, deinstitutionalization and radical acceptance. We believe that actualizing Queer liberation is possible through the relationships we nurture and build with each other. Community care is revolutionary, and our intersectional programming reflects that sentiment. The Collective is proudly run by a variety of UVSS staff, work study students, student volunteers, and more."

*Language for this policy was drawn from the Harriet W. Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning at Brown University and the work of Monica Linden in particular.*

### Basic Needs 

I want you to thrive in this course and everywhere else. Please let me know as early as possible if you have any concerns or if you require any supports to succeed. I'll do my best to help. If, for instance, you need to cover gaps in care, then please don't hesitate to bring your children to class meetings. Babies who are nursing are always welcome, as I do not want you to choose between feeding your child and continuing your education. 

UVic takes student mental health very seriously, with a [website](https://www.uvic.ca/student-wellness/wellness-resources/mental-health/) full of resources. They offer services such as assistance and referral to address students' personal, social, career, and study skills concerns. Services for students also include crisis and emergency mental health consultation, confidential assessment, and counselling services (individual and small group). Many of these programs are connected with [Student Wellness](https://www.uvic.ca/student-wellness/index.php), which you may contact by phone. 

The [Student Affairs website](https://www.uvic.ca/studentaffairs/) lists several policies, knowledge of which may make your life at UVic safer and easier. Only some of them are directly related to this course, but they're still important.

*Language for this policy was drawn from the work of Richard Pickard at UVic.*
