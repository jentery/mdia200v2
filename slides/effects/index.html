	  <section id="begin" data-background-color="#dddfd4">
		<h1>Let's begin with a common claim. Perhaps you've<br>heard it in popular discourse or the media.</h1>
		</section>	

	<section id="claim" data-background-color="#dddfd4">
	<h1>"Violent video games cause<br>violent behaviours."</h1>
	</section>

	<section id="define" data-background-color="#dddfd4">
		<h2>Let's define what "violent" could mean here and<br>compare it with terms such as<br>"aggressive" and  "competitive."</h2><h2>An important question emerges from the<br>use of "cause violent behaviours" as well:</h2>
		</section>	

	<section id="doyou" data-background-color="#dddfd4">
	<h1>Do people tend to passively, actively, or selectively engage media? How about video games in particular?</h1>
	<small>The first one is a perennial question in Media Studies.</small>
	</section>	

	<section id="effects" data-background-color="#fae596">
	<h1>Media Effects Research</h1>
	</section>
	
	<section id="forms" data-background-color="#fae596">
	<h2>In effects research, media are forms<br>that <em>impact</em> culture and society.</h2>
	<small>"Violent video games <em>cause</em> violent behaviours," for instance. The content and particulars of a game<br>don't really matter for this claim. It speaks generally or vaguely of them as a form.</small>
	</section>

	<section id="effect" data-background-color="#fae596">
		<h2>The effect is usually one of three types:<br>direct, minimal, or third-person.</h2>
		</section>
	
	<section id="direct" data-background-color="#3fb0ac">
	<h2>The "direct effect" position would claim<br>that violent games cause audiences<br>to think or behave violently.</h2>
	<h2><em>Academic research does not, however,<br>demonstrate a link between game violence<br>and violent crimes in North America.</em></h2>
	<small>See, for instance, the American Psychological Association's <a href="https://www.apa.org/about/policy/resolution-violent-video-games.pdf">"Resolution on Video Games"</a>:<br>"Attributing violence to violent video gaming is not scientifically sound and draws attention<br>away from other factors." Note: my literature review is limited to North America.</small></small>		
	</section>
	
	<section id="minimal" data-background-color="#173e43">
	<h2>The "minimal effect" position would claim<br>that violent games encourage or reinforce<br>aggressive behaviours.</h2>
	<h2><em>Violent video games may temporarily alter<br>people's moods, for instance.</em></h2>
	<small>See <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111790">"The Effect of Online Violent Video Games on Levels of Aggression"</a><br>by Hollingdale and Greitemeyer as well as <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/13/6/904">"Short-Term Effects of Competitive Video Games<br>on Aggression: An Event-Related Potential Study"</a> by Sun, Hao, and Liu.</small>
	</section>
	
	<section id="meta" data-background-color="#173e43">
	<h2>However, meta-analytic studies demonstrate<br>practically no long-term effects of violent<br>video games on aggression.</h2> 
	<small>See 	<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.200373">"Do Longitudinal Studies Support Long-term Relationships between Aggressive Game Play<br>and Youth Aggressive Behaviour? A Meta-analytic Examination"</a> by Drummond et al.</small>
	</section>

	<section id="third" data-background-color="#dddfd4">
	<h2>The "third-person effect" position would<br>claim that, "Violent games affect<br> other people but not me."</h2>
	<h2>You might say (for good reason) that violent<br>video games are repugnant, for instance.</h2>
	<h2><em>This is a moral position.</em></h2>
	<small>Matt McCormick asks, "[I]s participating in simulated violence even where there is no victim itself<br>somehow morally objectionable? Is there anything wrong with going through the motions of an immoral act, <br>and if so what is it?" (<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mccormickphilosophy/home/mccormick-research/is-it-wrong-to-play-violent-video-games">"Is It Wrong to Play Violent Video Games?"</a>)</small>
	</section>

	<section id="recap" data-background-color="#fae596">
	<h2>Let's recap before we proceed:<br>direct, minimal, and third-person effects.</h2>
	</section>

	<section id="theories" data-background-color="#fae596">
		<h2>Now for a few theories related to<br>the media effects paradigm . . .</h2>
		</section>

	<section id="cultivation" data-background-color="#3fb0ac">
	<h2>Cultivation theories of media effects would<br>claim that violent video games lead<br>players to accept games as reality.</h2>
	<h2>You might say (for good reason) that violent<br>video games desensitize players to video game<br>violence, which players tacitly accept as the norm.</h2>
	<h2><em>Yet desensitization to video game violence does not<br>correlate with desensitization to violent crimes.</em></h2>
	<small>See James Shanahan and Michael Morgan for more on cultivation theories. Also see Gao et al.,<br><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00650/full">"Long-Time Exposure to Violent Video Games Does Not Show Desensitization on Empathy for Pain"</a> and<br>Lengersdorff et al., <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84951">"Neuroimaging and Behavioral Evidence that Violent Video Games Exert No Negative<br>Effect on Human Empathy for Pain and Emotional Reactivity to Violence."</a></small>
	</section>

	<section id="gratification" data-background-color="#173e43">
		<h2>Uses and gratification theories (UGT) of<br>media effects would claim that violent video<br>games fulfill people's wants and needs.</h2>
		<h2>You might say (for good reason) that violent<br>games appeal to power fantasies or escapism.</h2>
		<h2><em>However, this position relies heavily on<br>individual choice and doesn't tell us why and<br>when people want to escape or fantasize about power.</em></h2>
		<small>See Harold Lasswell for more on uses and gratification theories. Also see Sherry et al.,<br><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John-Sherry-2/publication/259583577_Video_game_uses_and_gratifications_as_predictors_of_use_and_game_preference/links/54dc196b0cf28d3de65e9fed/Video-game-uses-and-gratifications-as-predictors-of-use-and-game-preference.pdf">"Video Game Uses and Gratifications as Predictors of Use and Game Preference,"</a> and Bonny and Castaneda,<br>who write: "UGT focuses on sustained player engagement with videogames as a function of motivation to seek <br>gratification from videogames" (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/10468781211070624#:~:text=Uses%20and%20gratification%20theory%20(UGT,in%20video%20game%20player%20preferences">"To Triumph or to Socialize? The Role of Gaming<br>Motivations in Multiplayer Online Battle Arena Gameplay Preferences."</a></small>
		</section>

	<section id="sociallearning" data-background-color="#dddfd4">
		<h2>Social learning theories of media effects would<br>claim that violent video games model<br>behaviours that players mimic.</h2>
			<h2>You might say (for good reason) that violent<br>games encourage fans to produce media<br>imitating violent behaviours.</h2>
			<h2><em>However, this position risks assuming that players are<br>passive vessels for reproducing violence.</em></h2>
			<small>See Albert Bandura for more on social learning or "social cognitive" theories. Shao and Wang write:<br>"According to Bandura's social cognitive theory, violent video games can initiate adolescents' observational learning.<br>In this situation, not only can they imitate the aggressive behavior of the model but also their understanding<br>and acceptability about aggression may change" (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6394371/#:~:text=According%20to%20Bandura's%20social%20cognitive,acceptability%20about%20aggression%20may%20change">"The Relation of Violent Video Games to<br>Adolescent Aggression: An Examination of Moderated Mediation Effect"</a>).</small>
			</section>

			<section id="agendasetting" data-background-color="#fae596">
				<h2>Agenda-setting theories of media effects would<br>claim that politicians and the media influence what people think about violent video games.</h2>
					<h2>You might say (for good reason) that moral panic<br>narratives and funding initiatives shape<br>what people hear and learn about video games.</h2>
					<h2><em>This corresponds with the "Goldilocks effect":<br>each generation believes its experience of media<br>was the correct or best one.</em></h2>
				<small>See <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1166785.pdf">"Teaching Us to Fear"</a> by Markey and Ferguson for more on<br>moral panics and scapegoat narratives involving video games.</small>
					</section>
	
					<section id="related" data-background-color="#3fb0ac">
						<h2>Some other issues to consider:</h2>
						<h2>Violent crime rates in the US tend to drop<br>when AAA games are released.</h2>
						<h2>Gamer cultures invested in violent video<br>games are often toxic and hostile.</h2>
						<h2>Video games don't <em>cause</em> these cultural phenomena,<br>but what approaches (beyond media effects)<br>help us to better understand them?</h2>
					<small>See Markey et al., <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/garbelottoat/wp-content/uploads/marky-etal-2014.pdf">"Violent Video Games and Real-World Violence: Rhetoric Versus Data,"</a><br>and Kishonna Gray's <a href="https://lsupress.org/9780807174555/intersectional-tech/"><em>
